<section>
  <p>I am an undergraduate studying pure and applied mathematics at Boston University. This website is a side project I have used to familiarize myself with HTML and to maintain a repository of my worked solutions to various problems in textbooks that I come across. It is also a convenient place to store my math-related notes and references. If you are looking for solutions to specific problems in a textbook, click below to see if I have covered it. I cannot promise perfect solutions, as I am still learning. </p>

  <i>> Organic Chemistry: Principles of Reaction Mechanisms</i> (2020) --- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Principles-Reaction-Mechanisms/dp/B08RH7J66R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6XT6PLRD6JFN&keywords=organic+chemistry+principles+of+reaction+mechanisms&qid=1654038231&sprefix=organic+chemistry+principles+of+reaction+mechanisms%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1">[Amazon Link]</a>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>wrote a textbook covering topics pertinent to a first semester of undergraduate-level organic chemistry. I was very interested in the subject and felt that the way I best learned the material was worth sharing.</li>
  <li>topics covered include: bonding & resonance, orbital hybridization, stereochemistry, organic nomenclature, the chemistry of alkenes and alkynes, SN1/E1 and SN2/E2 reactions, acid-base chemistry, as well as choice components of the reactions of alcohols and thiols.</li>
</ul>
