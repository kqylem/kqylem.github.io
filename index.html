            <h2>Welcome, this is my website!</h2>
            <p>I am a masters student studying pure and applied mathematics at Boston University. 
                This website is a repository of various items. I have included current projects I am working on, 
                a resume, a collectiom of poetry and writing, 
                expository math papers, solutions manuals I have made for textbooks, and solved math problems more generally. 
                my worked solutions to various problems in textbooks that I come across. 
                If you are looking for solutions to specific problems in a textbook, go to the math tab to see if I've covered it. 
                I cannot promise perfect solutions. </p>
