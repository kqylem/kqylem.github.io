            <h2>Welcome, this is my website!</h2>
            <p>I am a masters student studying pure and applied mathematics at Boston University. 
                This website is a repository of various items. I have included current projects I am working on, 
                a resume, a collectiom of poetry and writing, 
                expository math papers, solutions manuals I have made for textbooks, and solved math problems more generally. 
                my worked solutions to various problems in textbooks that I come across. 
                If you are looking for solutions to specific problems in a textbook, go to the math tab to see if I've covered it. 
                I cannot promise perfect solutions. </p>

  <ul>
  <i>> Organic Chemistry: Principles of Reaction Mechanisms</i> (2020) --- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-Principles-Reaction-Mechanisms/dp/B08RH7J66R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6XT6PLRD6JFN&keywords=organic+chemistry+principles+of+reaction+mechanisms&qid=1654038231&sprefix=organic+chemistry+principles+of+reaction+mechanisms%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-1">[Amazon Link]</a>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>wrote a textbook covering topics pertinent to a first semester of undergraduate-level organic chemistry. I was very interested in the subject and felt that the way I best learned the material was worth sharing.</li>
  <li>topics covered include: bonding & resonance, orbital hybridization, stereochemistry, organic nomenclature, the chemistry of alkenes and alkynes, SN1/E1 and SN2/E2 reactions, acid-base chemistry, as well as choice components of the reactions of alcohols and thiols.</li>
